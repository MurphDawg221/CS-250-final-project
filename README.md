    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

    Throughout this course we used user stories to help communicate and interpret the user needs as discussed in the initial
    interview with the client. These user stories helped provide a visual representation of all the users of the system and 
    the needs of the users. This helps developers break down the systems functional requirements to and testers to develop 
    test cases for the system. 
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

    I approach developing programs with by breaking them down into smaller pieces that way they can be easily updated more and
    more to creating a more well rounded higher quality system that suits the clients wants and expectations. Iterative 
    development is one way to accomplish this, as well as through the use of test driven development. I hope to be able to 
    incorporate these practices in my future work with agile development process.
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

    I think what it means to be a good team member is to have good communication skills firstly with that the team will always
    know what to expect from you and be more prepared. I think helping others if they are stuck because I would hope for the same
    if I am struggling to figure something out. Then one of the final things I think that doesn't really get thought of because
    most people assume is to always seek self improvement if you are better the team will ultimately be better because of the 
    effort and expertise you bring to the table. Software development is forever a growing field and it isn't helpful nor 
    valuable to the team if you aren't growing with it by practicing your skills as a developer or certifying yourself in other
    means that could be beneficial to the work environment.
